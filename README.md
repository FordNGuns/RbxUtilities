# RbxUtilities
 This is my collection of utility modules I created while learning Luau and Roblox development. Are they overengineered? Absolutely! But that was kind of the point - I wanted to understand how these systems work by building them from scratch.

## Why So Complex?
I know these modules are overengineered. They have:
- Extensive type checking
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full documentation
- Edge case coverage
- More features than I'll probably use

## Should You Use This?
If you're looking for production ready utilities, probably not. There are simpler, battle tested solutions out there.

But if you're:
- Learning Luau/Roblox development
- Interested in seeing different implementation approaches
- Want to understand how these systems work under the hood
- Just curious about overengineered code

Then feel free to poke around! But remember sometimes simpler is better.
